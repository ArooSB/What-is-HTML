# What-is-HTML

HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language.
The collection of markup symbols or codes added to a file with the intention 
of displaying it online is known as HyperText Markup Language, or HTML. The markup instructs
web browsers on how to display the text and graphics on a webpage.

Although many people also refer to it as a tag, each individual piece of markup code (which would 
fall between the characters "" and ">") is referred to as an element. Certain elements come in pairs that show the
start and stop times of display effects.

Important lessons learnt
The fundamental scripting language that web browsers utilise to render pages on the Internet is called HyperText Markup Language, or HTML.
With hypertext, a user can click a link and be taken to a new page that the link references.
Web 2.0 and 3.0 are examples of more recent HTML versions that offer far more dynamic flexibility than Web 1.0, which was static.
Content is everything outside of two pointed brackets (between "\" and ">"). Markup is the text that appears between them.
Comprehending HTML
The computer language that makes creating websites easier is called HyperText Markup Language. With code terms and grammar 
identical to any other language, the language is very simple to understand and, with time, gains more and more creative potential. 
Under the direction of the World Wide Web Consortium, which creates and maintains the language, HTML continues to change to satisfy
the needs and specifications of the internetâ€”for example, with the move to Web 2.0.

Users of the internet navigate the web via hypertext. Users can access new pages by clicking on hyperlinks, which are special text. 
By clicking on the available links, users can navigate anywhere on the internet because hypertext is not linear. HTML tags designate 
the text that appears within them as markup, designating it as a particular kind of text. Markup text can take various forms, such as
boldface or italicised text, to highlight a word or phrase.
